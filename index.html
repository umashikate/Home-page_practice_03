                What is an optical fiber line?</br>
                An optical fiber line uses a communication line called an optical fiber to access
                the Internet. Optical fiber is a light-passing cable made of quartz glass or plastic
                that uses the reflection and refraction of light to transmit data. Because optical
                fiber is a transmission method that uses the characteristics of light transmission,
                it is not easily affected by distance or external noise.

                The work of a network engineer basically involves working silently, so those who
                can tackle something steadily are suited for the job. There is a lot of steady learning
                when it comes to IT technology, and those who are not bothered by such tasks will be
                able to acquire qualifications smoothly. For example, people who like detailed work in
                general and can continue to work hard on a continuous basis are suited for this job.

                A good place for engineers to work includes a good infrastructure for development
                as well as an environment where employees work smoothly together. Many companies

                So what happens when you turn on a VPN? In a nutshell, turning on a VPN encrypts
                your Internet traffic, protecting your personal information from third parties and
                cybercriminals and greatly increasing your privacy and security.
